**From MVP to Category-Defining CSR Operating System**

> **Current Status**: Feature-complete MVP.
> **Target State**: Defensible, sticky, compliance-heavy Enterprise SaaS.

## 🛡 Pillar 1: The Trust & Compliance Moat (Core IP)
*The foundation of the platform's valuation.*

### A. Dynamic Trust Score Engine (Immediate Priority)
- **Concept**: Move from static rating to a weighted, real-time algorithmic score.
- **Inputs**:
  - Regulatory Freshness (CSR-1, FCRA expiry tracking).
  - Financial Health (Volatility, Expense Ratios).
  - Operational Discipline (Reporting punctuality).
  - Social Proof (Corporate endorsements).
- **Output**: A "Credit Score" for NGOs (300-900 scale).

### B. Continuous Compliance Monitoring
- **Push vs Pull**: Automated quarterly scraping of MCA/Income Tax portals (simulated for now).
- **Risk Alerts**: Immediate notification to corporate donors if an NGO's status changes (e.g., 12A revoked).

---

## 💰 Pillar 2: Money Flow Control
*Solving the CFO's anxiety.*

### A. Escrow-Based Tranches
- **Smart Contracts (Logic)**: Funds sit in a virtual escrow, not the NGO's account, until unlocked.
- **Verification-Gated**: `UC Upload` + `Geo-tagged Photo` -> `AI Review` -> `Fund Release`.

### B. Audit-Ready Ledger
- **One-Click "Big 4" Pack**: Export Schedule VII mapped reports, financial trails, and impact proofs in a single ZIP.

---

## 🧠 Pillar 3: High-Leverage AI
*AI that reduces fraud and workload, not just chatbots.*

### A. Proposal Doctor (For NGOs)
- AI reviews grant applications for "Acceptance Probability" before submission.
- Checks budget realism and outcome measurability.

### B. Forensic Impact Verifier
- Analyze uploaded photos for:
  - Duplicates (reverse image search).
  - Metadata mismatches (GPS/Time).
  - Context validity (Does this look like a "school" in "Bihar"?).

---

## 🏢 Pillar 4: Enterprise-Grade Architecture

### A. Portfolio Dashboard
- Risk heatmaps (Geographic concentration, Sector overexposure).
- YoY Impact Analysis.

### B. RBAC (Role-Based Access Control)
- Distinct views for: `CSR Head` (Strategy), `Finance` (Disbursal), `Auditor` (Read-only).

---

## 🌐 Pillar 5: Network Effects

- **Collaboration Graph**: Visualizing links between NGOs, Corporates, and Projects.
- **Field App**: Offline-first data collection tool for volunteers.
